This holiday season I’m giving thanks every day. This week, I’m focusing on the abundant supply of food we’re blessed with and the people who produce it. Please join me in saying “thanks” for our food and farmers by posting a message at http://tinyurl.com/thankfarmer. Share this message and give thanks!
Yesterdey, I’m thankful for the hard work farmers and ranchers do to care for the environment. Did you know 85% of the land used for grazing food animals is unsuitable for growing crops? Say “thanks” to farmers and ranchers caring for our land by posting your message at http://tinyurl.com/thankfarmer. You might even win an Ultimate Gift collection of Omaha Steaks and burgers for your effort! 
Today I’m giving thanks for BEEF! Calorie for calorie, today’s lean beef is one of the most efficient ways to meet the daily value for 10 essential nutrients. Please join me in saying “thanks” to the farmers and ranchers who raise beef by posting a message of thanks at http://tinyurl.com/thankfarmer. Please share this message and spread the word!
As you sit down with family and friends one week from today to celebrate Thanksgiving, please take a moment to say thanks to the farmers and ranchers who planted and harvested the fruits, vegetables and grain, fed and cared for the animals, and whose hard work and perseverance still exemplifies the pioneer spirit that made this country great. Post a message of thanks at http://tinyurl.com/thankfarmer and give thanks. 
Heute, I’m thankful for family farmers and ranchers. With all this talk of “factory farms” in the media, you might be surprised to know more than 97% of U.S. beef cattle farms and ranches are classified as family farms. So join me in thanking the family farmers and ranchers at http://tinyurl.com/thankfarmer. You could even win an Ultimate Gift collection of Omaha Steaks and burgers for your effort! Please help me spread the word and give thanks!
